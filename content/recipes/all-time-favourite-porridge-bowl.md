introduction: 'Especially in winter, when we wake up and it is still dark outside
  and way too cold to hatch out under the warm soft duvet, we need a motivation boost
  in the morning. Something to look forward to. So much that we leave the warm bed
  behind us and make our way to the kitchen. The solution: warm porridge that warms
  you from the inside and gives you strength for the day. Also quite healthy and made
  very fast.'
serving: serves 2
