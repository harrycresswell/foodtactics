introduction: 'Breakfast is my favourite meal of the day. Preferably always with lots
  of fruit to start the day with a good portion of vitamins. Another important component:
  crunchy granola. Whether as a topping on porridge or pancakes, with milk or with
  yoghurt, granola always tastes delicious and provides a lot of energy. In addition,
  it can be made at home very easily and fast. And the best about it: you can be sure
  that no unnecessary sugar is hidden in it and that all your favourite ingredients
  are mixed in. This is our basic Granola recipe, in which oats, seeds and nuts come
  together and are baked in some coconut oil and honey. Of course, you can vary the
  nuts and seeds you use. You can try different spices and after baking add dried
  fruits like dates or banana chips – there are no limits to your imagination.<br>'

- ingredient_list_title: ''
  ingredient:
  - 300 g oats
  - 150 g nuts of choice (we used almonds and cashews)
  - 100 g seeds of choice (we used sunflower, pumpkin and flax seeds)
  - 30 g coconut oil
  - 50 g honey / agave syrup
  - 1 pinch of salt
  - 1 pinch of cinnamon
tactic: Chop the nuts roughly and mix them in a large bowl with the oats and seeds.
  Put the coconut oil together and the honey in a small pot and heat both on a low
  flame while stirring constantly. As soon as the honey and the oil have combined,
  add the salt and the cinnamon. Stir the liquid into the granola mixture until all
  the oats, seeds and nuts are slightly moist. Place everything on a baking tray lined
  with baking paper and bake the granola at 175 °C circulating air for approx. 15
  minutes. Check the granola in between because it can burn easily. Once it takes
  on a golden brown color, you can take it out of the oven. Let it cool completely
  and then fill it into an airtight container.
