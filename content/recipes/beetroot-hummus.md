introduction: Hummus is one of the things we really always have in the fridge. After
  all, it is not only delicious and a great source of plant based protein, it is also
  wonderfully versatile. It goes so well with falafel, oven baked vegetables, salads,
  as a dip … nevertheless, many hummus you can find in the supermarket contain unnecessarily
  much sugar and other additives, which have in a Hummus actually nothing to do. So
  why not make it yourself? We particularly like hummus with beetroot. The colour
  is amazing and the beetroot also gives it a sweet and tangy flavour.
