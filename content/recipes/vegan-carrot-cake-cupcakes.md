introduction: 'When I enter a café and there is Carrot Cake, I don’t have to think
  long about which cake to choose. Carrot Cake it is. Preferably nice and juicy with
  a creamy frosting. Since I first ate Carrot Cake a few years ago, this was a piece
  of the cake Harry had baked for his mother’s birthday. And I was right over the
  moon. Since then, we’ve been baking it for each other’s birthdays each year. <br><br>Friday
  evening it came over me again: the irrepressible desire for a piece of this juicy
  delicacy. I only had one problem: my favourite recipe is unfortunately full of butter,
  cream cheese and refined sugar. That’s okay every now and again, but I found that
  a healthier version had to be found. And so on Friday night I took my favourite
  recipe and turned it into a vegan, healthier cupcake version. And trust me: I am
  VERY satisfied with the result! Make sure you try it!'

- ingredient_list_title: ''
  ingredient:
  - 2 chia eggs (1 tbsp chia seeds + 3 tbsp water = 1 chia egg)
  - 90 g coconut sugar
  - 35 g date syrup
  - 125 g margarine
  - 225 g spelt flour
  - 1 tbsp baking powder
  - 1½ tsp ground ginger
  - "½ tsp cloves"
  - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
  - 1 apple
  - 200 g carrots
  - 1 organic orange, zest and juice
- ingredient_list_title: 'For the icing:'
  ingredient:
  - 200g coconut yoghurt
  - "½ pack agar agar (7 g)"
  - 1 tbsp date, agave or maple syrup
  - 1 organic orange, juice and zest
  - handful of walnuts
tactic: Preheat the oven to 180ºC and grease a muffin tin with margarine.<br><br>Mix
  chia eggs, coconut sugar, date syrup and margarine in a bowl. Stir well to combine.
  Add flour, baking powder and spices and stir again. Peel apple and carrots and grate.
  Add to the batter along with orange juice and zest.<br><br>Using two spoons, transfer
  batter to the muffin tin, filling each one up to about three quarters. Bake in the
  oven for about 35 minutes. Muffins should be golden brown and inserted skewer should
  come out clean. Leave the muffins to cool for about 5 minutes, then take them out
  onto a baking rack to cool completely.<br><br>Meanwhile make the icing by mixing
  the coconut yoghurt with the syrup and orange zest. Squeeze orange and heat up the
  juice with agar agar in a small pot. Bring to a boil whilst stirring constantly.
  Then remove from heat and add juice to the yoghurt. Stir well, then let the icing
  cool down in the fridge for about 10 minutes.<br><br>Muffins should have cooled
  down by now. Take the icing out of the fridge, stir once more and decorate the muffins
  with it. Add chopped walnuts on top. Cupcakes are best kept in the fridge.
