introduction: Since I made the chocolate pudding for the first time, I canâ€™t get enough
  of it. It is the perfect dessert and a great afternoon snack when you are craving
  something sweet. Luckily the sweet taste comes solely from the bananas and no refined
  sugar must be added. Chia seeds create the pudding like texture and add extra nutrients.
serving: serves 2
ingredient_list:
- ingredient_list_title: ''
  ingredient:
  - 2 frozen bananas
  - 2 tbsp chia seeds
  - 1 tbsp cocoa powder
  - 10 tablespoons oat milk/almond
  - milk/water
- ingredient_list_title: 'Topping:'
  ingredient:
  - coconut yoghurt
  - berries of your choice
  - granola
tactic: Remove the skin from the bananas and cut them into slices. Put these in a
  freezable container and freeze them. (Very ripe bananas are particularly suitable
  for this. I always have a few in the freezer.)<br><br>Mix the chia seeds with the
  plant milk or water. Leave the whole thing to stand for a while and then stir again
  until the chia seeds have absorbed the liquid and a gel-like consistency has formed.<br><br>Put
  the frozen bananas, the chia pudding and the cocoa powder into a food processor
  and pulsate until a creamy consistency is formed. If it's still a little too firm,
  just add a little more plant milk.<br><br>Fill the pudding into small bowls or glasses
  and top it with yoghurt, fruit and granola as desired.
