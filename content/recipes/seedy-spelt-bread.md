introduction: Recently, on a Saturday morning, we felt like baking our own bread again.
  After all, fresh bread tastes particularly good with a weekend breakfast. And so
  we threw a few ingredients we had in the house into a bowl and were more than enthusiastic
  about the result. The result was a delicious bread with a crunchy edge and a fluffy
  interior full of good ingredients. Spelt flour and many seeds form the basis for
  this bread. In addition there is only some dry yeast, a little agave syrup, salt
  and water. After only 2 hours the dough has risen nicely and is ready for baking.
  The bread lasts about 1 week and also tastes great toasted.

ingredient_list:
- ingredient_list_title: ''
  ingredient:
  - 500 g spelt flour
  - 1 sachet dry yeast (7 g)
  - 4 tbsp sunflower seeds
  - 4 tbsp sesame
  - 4 tbsp flax seeds
  - 1 1/2 tsp sea salt
  - 1 tbsp agave syrup
  - 300 ml lukewarm water
tactic: Mix the flour, yeast, seeds and salt together in a bowl. Stir the agave syrup
  into the lukewarm water and pour the liquid over the flour. Knead everything with
  your hands or the dough hook to a smooth dough. It'll take about 10 minutes. If
  it's still too damp, just add a little more flour. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen
  towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for at least an hour.<br><br>Grease
  a square bread tin with a little oil or margarine. Take the dough out of the bowl,
  knead it again and put it into the mould. Cover this one again and let the dough
  rise a little bit more for another hour.<br><br>In the meantime, preheat the oven
  to 200Â°C. After the bread has risen nicely in the tin, put it in the oven and bake
  it for about 40 minutes. After the baking time, let the bread cool down a little
  in the tin before you take it out.
