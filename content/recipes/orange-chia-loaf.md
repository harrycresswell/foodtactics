introduction: "Spring is slowly coming to Hamburg and with the rays of the sun comes
  the zest for action and we feel like romping around in the kitchen again. When we
  were expecting friends on the weekend we knew we had to use this energy and bake
  a cake. It had to be light and airy, springlike. And so we decided to bake an orange
  cake. And, guys, it’s turned out great – we’re blown away! The consistency is simply
  perfect: light and fluffy. The orange syrup that is poured over the cake gives it
  a particularly juicy and fruity taste. Ground almonds and hazelnuts enhance the
  orange aroma, chia seeds provide the right crunch. The cake can be stirred together
  in the blink of an eye and tastes just as great warm straight from the oven as it
  does after a few days in the tupper ware. We would go so far as to say that this
  is the best cake we’ve eaten in a long time, but maybe we’re biased \U0001F642 Try
  it out!<br>"

ingredient_list:
- ingredient_list_title: ''
  ingredient:
  - 140 g coconut sugar
  - 30 g brown sugar
  - 2 eggs
  - 2 tbsp chia seeds
  - 2 organic oranges
  - 1 tbsp olive oil
  - 150 g (vegan) butter
  - 200 g ground almonds
  - 70 g ground hazel nuts
  - 110 g spelt flour
  - 1 tsp baking powder
  - 1 pinch of cinnamon
tactic: 'Preheat the oven to 180°C and grease a loaf pan with a little butter.<br><br>In
  a small bowl mix the chia seeds with 9 tablespoons of water and stir well. Leave
  it for a few minutes and stir again. A gel-like consistency should develop.<br><br>In
  the meantime, wash the oranges with hot water and rub the peel of one of the oranges.
  Place the orange zest in a mixing bowl and mix with the Chia gel, eggs, brown sugar,
  100 g coconut blossom sugar, olive oil and butter.<br><br>In a second bowl, combine
  the almonds, hazelnuts, flour, baking powder and cinnamon then add the flour mixture
  to the other ingredients. Stir everything briefly.<br><br>Place the dough in the
  pan and bake for 35 minutes on the middle shelf of the oven. Just before the end
  of the baking time, you can start making the syrup for the cake. Squeeze out both
  oranges and mix with the remaining coconut sugar in a small pot. Bring to a boil,
  then let simmer for about ten more minutes and stir well. Take the cake out of the
  oven and let it cool down a little. Then remove from the mould and prick small holes
  in the cake with a wooden stick. Now pour the syrup over it and serve.<br><br>Tip:
  We only poured about half the syrup over right after baking. We then kept the remaining
  syrup in a little tupper box and poured it over the cake the following days, so
  that the cake would stay nice and juicy.'
