introduction: The cookies melts and crumbles on your tongue. It leaves a hint of peanut
  and Christmas feelings. Best of all, they are vegan, super quick to prepare, not
  that unhealthy and you probably have the ingredients at home anyway.
serving: makes about 40 cookies
ingredient_list: []
tactic: Simply mix all ingredients for the dough together. Add as much cinnamon and
  clove powder as you like. Knead well with your hands. If the dough is too dry, simply
  add a little more peanut butter or olive oil. If it's too dry, add a little more
  flour.<br><br>Form the dough into a ball and let cool in the fridge for approx.
  1 hour.<br>Then roll out onto a floured work surface and start cutting cookies.
  Transfer to a baking tray with parchment and bake at 170Â° for about 20 minutes,
  or until edges turn golden brown.<br><br>Let the cookies cool down. Mix powdered
  sugar with water or lemon juice and coat the cookies.
