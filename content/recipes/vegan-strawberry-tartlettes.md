introduction: The sun tickles on the skin and there’s a a breath of sun cream and
  happiness in the air – summer in Hamburg shows its pretty face.<br><br>Small stalls
  selling strawberries from the region line our neighbouring streets and in the cool
  shade of our kitchen we long for summerly light delicacies.<br><br>A base with just
  the right crunch, a cream that melts on the tongue and fresh strawberries – turned
  in a little bit of agave syrup to emphasise the the natural sweetness even more.
  Does that sound alright?<br><br>And here we go – the perfect summer dessert, a great
  addition to Sunday’s brunch, a surprise for your mum, your best friend or just because
  you feel like having a sweetie. And the best thing about it? These small tarts are
  entirely vegan and free from refined sugar.
tactic: Start by chopping the strawberries into small cubes and mix them in a bowl
  together with the agave nectar.<br><br>Preheat the oven to 150°C.<br><br>Mix the
  oats and almonds in a food processor until they reach a flour like consistency.<br><br>Put
  the mixture into a mixing bowl and add the remaining dry ingredients.<br><br>Heat
  up the coconut oil on a low heat until completely liquid.<br><br>Add the coconut
  oil and the plant milk to the dry ingredients - you should get a pasty consistency
  when you press the mixture between your fingers. If it is still a little too dry,
  simply add a little more coconut oil.<br><br>Brush your muffin tin with coconut
  oil and spread the dough on 6 moulds.<br><br>Press it into the mould with your fingers
  so that a small edge is formed. Use a fork to stab a few small holes in the ground.<br><br>Bake
  the tart bases in the oven for about 10 - 15 minutes until the edges turn slightly
  golden brown and let cool down completely.<br><br>Mix the yoghurt with the coconut
  sugar, agave syrup and a few drops of vanilla extract (optional).<br><br>Stir the
  agar agar into the cold water. Once combined, heat the mixture together with the
  plant milk in a small pot. Let it boil once, then take the pot off the stove.<br><br>Mix
  the agar agar mixture immediately with the yoghurt cream (Be quick! - otherwise
  the agar agar will set!)<br><br>Spread the cream on the cooled tart bases.<br><br>Put
  the strawberries on top and let the tartlets cool in the fridge for at least an
  hour.
