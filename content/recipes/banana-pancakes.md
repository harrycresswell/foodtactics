introduction: As much as we love a creamy porridge for breakfast, when we have more
  time at the weekend, we like changing up the breakfast game. Pancakes! Stirring
  the various ingredients together in pyjamas, the smell that fills the kitchen as
  soon as the batter touches the hot pan for the first time and slowly layering pancake
  after pancake on top of each other to form an ever-increasing stack. This is the
  pure weekend feeling!
serving: makes about 10 pancakes

  - toppings of your choice
tactic: Mix the flour, the sugar, a pinch of salt and the baking powder in a bowl.
  Add cinnamon to taste.<br><br>Crush the banana and mix it with the milk and peanut
  butter in a second bowl. Then carefully fold the flour mixture into the banana mixture.
  Let the batter rest for about 10 minutes.<br><br>Heat some coconut oil in a pan
  and add about 2 tablespoons per pancake to the hot pan. As soon as small bubbles
  form on the surface, you can turn the pancake over. Serve with your favourite toppings.
  We love fresh fruit, coconut yoghurt and peanut butter.
